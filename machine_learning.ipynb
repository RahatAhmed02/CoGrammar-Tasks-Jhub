    "* 1.2. The system can extract data from what the user has rated highly or spent a lot of time on, such as movie genre or date released and recommend similar movies according to tags and not recommend ones already watched and disliked genres. Patterns can be determined based on the users viewing and browsing habits.\n",

    "* 1.3. Users have distinct writing style and also signatures. The name, design, letters used combine to produce unique signatures. So approaching it like a fingerprint, whereby we monitor and record its unique qualities such that in the future if it needs to be verified, the database can assist in the decision of True or False. These situations of verification are often in high risk scenarios so a methodical approach is desirable.\n",

    "* 1.4. Lots of patients suffer from similar symptoms, doctors can miss related symptoms the can alter a whole diagnosis. This system can ensure everything is considered simultaneously. Also it can predict what treatments are most likely to work based on past patient results."

    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* 2.2 Regression, because trends can be determined using numerical values, previous data/training sets have these intrinsic values for R2, MSE, RMSE etc, therefore new data or predictive models can utilise this and produce its regression models. It has continuous outputs.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* 2.3 Classification, because the training set has predefined the correct classes for features so new data if in line with the training set will be sorted into their classes. The algorithm needs to extract categorical data from the images.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* 2.4 Classification and regression. Classification because the database of pre-existing results has been linked to their diagnoses, therefore any new data if in line with these results can be classified into their corresponding classes, this is an example of categorical data. But to then further use the data to predict the likelihood of diseases, the regression algorithms can be used after the classification to give a probability score. Continuous data can be output due to the sorting that has already happened and is particular useful in healthcare settings. "

    "* 3.1 Unsupervised, there is no prior data to train the algorithm on to understand what is and isn’t an anomaly. Also, its not necessarily required to have a labelled data set prior because anomalous data by nature is distinct from the rest.\n",

    "* 3.3 Unsupervised, this is a data set that is current, and is not related to previous or future events. It can classify data real-time, so the algorithm can naturally group them without prior data. Therefore, the algorithm can produce patterns from this data purely based on the data provided to it there and then. However we have not been told if there are pre-defined labels, if that is the case we can benefit from a supervised learning algorithm to appropriately group data.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "* 3.4 Supervised and unsupervised. Although it is categorical data, which in some cases unsupervised algorithms flourish in, the themes are a time dependent trend. Themes can change over time as do social media trends. Therefore, to remain relevant and useful, previous data will be needed to classify data according to their theme. However, if the genre is predefined, then its possible to make use of a unsupervised algorithm which would be a simpler implementation. So unsupervised algorithms will help to discover new trends/themes on unlabelled data, and supervised algorithms will categorise into predefined themes from labelled data."

We are told most data is labelled so this is suitable for a supervised learning algorithm especially considering that there are only two classes (fraudulent and legitimate). But if the dataset is very large and therefore time consuming and computationally expensive, then semi-supervised learning algorithms may be applicable.\n",

We would have a good understanding of what is spam and not. However, if it is time consuming and computationally expensive, semi-supervised learning may be suitable especially since there is only two classes to categorise. Potentially it could identify some more patterns due to the variation in emails people send.\n",
